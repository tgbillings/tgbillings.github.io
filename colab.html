          <b> What is Kids colab? </b><br><br>
            Kids colab is a co-operative approach to design that involves one of our target users (students) in the design process. It is a way of participatory design that ensures that our students are heard. The kids co-lab group meets weekly during the school year for 2 hours per week, and have a 1 week summer camp, which they meet for 6 hours a day, every day during the week. The co-lab group consists of 12 middle school aged children who provide feedback for pearson products. I was a key player in making this effort successful by moderating sessions and helping students execute their designs. I also provided analysis and insight after each session to report to the product teams that were testing or gaining information about their designs.
            <br><br> <b>Why is participatory design important? </b><br><br>
            Participatory design is a process, and not a style. In point of participatory design is not to have users design products, but to gain insight as to why they might want to make a certain design choices. It allows for a better cultural and societal understanding of their day-to-day problems and the mental models that lead to certain solutions. It does not help pearson to know that students want to design a magical home-work creating robot, but the invaluable information is the stress and pressure that students feel from their parents, teachers, and peers when it comes to completing their homework on time while maintaining a social life balance, all while trying to look “cool.” <br><br><b>What happens in a colab session? </b> <br><br>
            There are many different ways we utilize the time spent with the students. Almost all of these research sessions are Qualitative, direct and attitudinal. The sessions differ depending on what research question needs to be answered. One of the most common sessions is showing the students a current pearson design, and asking them to make changes, and document why each change is made. Another example is having students design their own solution to a problem, such as designing a new way to read your textbook, or design a new way to learn math that isn’t through a video, teacher or textbook.  <br><br> <b> Jump to a section </b>

            <b> Methodology </b> <br><br>
            The Kids Colab team (11 middle grade students, myself & director of research) were asked to design a student website that might be a part of a Pearson product. First, the students brainstormed what they’d like to see on a student webpage. Then, we asked students to create a website including those features using a Layered Elaboration approach. <br><br>Layered Elaboration is a technique using transparencies.<br><br> <ul><li>Each group creates the homepage using the transparency adding the must have and desired elements.</li>
            <li>All groups come back together  for a “stand up meeting” where each group briefly presents their ideas to the other group.</li>
            <li>The kid design partners rotate to the next group while the adult partners stay on their page. Put a clear transparency on top of group 1’s revisions, along with the “2” in the upper right hand corner and names/initials of the group members. </li>
            <li>New groups elaborate on the initial idea by adding to, editing, and changing the first groups ideas. However, all deletions are done by crossing out ideas instead of erasing them, thus leaving all iterations in tact.</li>
            <li>Continue with stand-up meetings and new transparencies iteratively until each group has had a chance to elaborate on each paper. </li>
            <li>Photos are being taken after each layer.</li></ul>

            The Elementary Language Arts Team would like to gauge the age level appropriateness of the game, Urchin Search.<br><br>First, the Kids Colab team evaluated the game in small groups. Each kid got several minutes to play the game. They were asked their likes, dislikes, and areas of confusion. The kids were instructed to think about the gameplay and format of the game, not the content. <br><br> Then, students were asked to rate the general appeal of the game on a 4-point scale. They were also asked to choose all the grade levels for which they felt the game was appropriate. <br><br>Next, the Colab team was asked to make specific modifications to the game to make it appropriate for grades 3rd - 5th. They were asked which elements must be change, would be nice to change, and don’t need to change to make appropriate for grades 3-5.

            <b>Key factors in grade level appropriateness </b><br><br>
            The game was appropraite for a kindergarten and 1st grade because it was simple to follow, easy to follow along and there was nothing to confuse you. There are not alot of distractions, and all the levels are exactly the same format with little variation. The characters are also geared towards younger kinds, and did not feel right for 3rd to 5th graders. To make it more grade appropriate, the characters could be more complex, and the levels could vary more than just finding words. <b>The students were able to pick up on the idea that this is just a multiple choice quiz with a different visual.</b><br><br><b>Part 2: game modifications</b>
