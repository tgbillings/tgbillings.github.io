            Realize is a learning management system. It is the platform that contains all of Pearson’s digital products. Teachers can assign work to students, grade their assignments, host discussions and access their lesson plans in Realize. Subsequently, students go to realize to complete, and submit their assigned work for the teacher to grade.

            Background Research
          </div>
            Based on Quantitative Research from Google Analytics, <b>only 6% of our Students turn in their assignments</b>. Additionally, we lost out on a large adoption sale because <b>realize was “not a robust process for the student.”</b> The current problem is that the student turn-in workflow in realize is very complicated. Students often miss parts of their assignment, students can easily submit an incomplete assignment, and submitting an assignment can often be hidden so students miss submission entirely. <br><br> <b>Students need an easy way to work through, and turn in their assignments on Realize. </b>

            User Workflow
          </div>
            The current workflow has the student going to each part of the assignment on a new page. Below is an outline of the general user workflow for completing and turning in an assignment, as well as wires to what the UI used to look like.

            There are a few key problems with this current workflow. The constant back and forth between the actual part of the assignment, and the “November 3rd Assignment Page” meant that Alex would often lose track of his progress. Also, the turn in button, being at the top of the page is inconsistent with the user workflow, where the user would finish all parts, and then have to return to the top of the screen. Finally, having to click into an assignment that has a page to a link that has the reading selection is adding unnecessary clicks.

            Wireframes and Usability Testing
          </div>
            To validate that our designs, we wanted to test the solution. I created wireframes for usability and AB testing. While the metric used to indicate the problem was quantitative, we were limited in timeframe and budget. Ideally, I would have liked to use quantitative data in addition to qualitative to get a more accurate comparison. I created 2 different prototypes. One solution has a long vertical scroll, the other solution has tabs. Both solutions are more robust than the current designs. To test this, we used a task based A/B usability test on (5) Teachers and (6) Students in the Hoboken Area switching off the first prototype we showed to account for bias. We asked them the following tasks:

            Constraints & Visual Exploration
          </div>
            We then wanted to explore different visual treatments of this “tab” design. Below are some of the different ways we looked at exploring tabs. We looked at Material Design, flat design, and some more traditional approaches.<br><br> Based off of a combination of stakeholder feedback, and design heuristics, we decided to go with the white tabs on blue background (left design). Additionally, the tab approach allowed for better readability with color contrast, and allowed us to use colors to have meaning. In a future update, we will use color as a way of allowing the user to know the status of the assignment (blue means the assignment is in progress and green means the assignment is complete).

            The final product consisted of many different states. Shown below are only a few of these states, but the Assignment viewer is live in Realize today. Currently, Google analytics shows that the turn in rate is around 68%, which is far better than the previous designs. The next step is to validate even further to see how well we solved the problem. Also, there are going to be more features released in relation to the lesson viewer, including Rubrics functionality, teacher-student commenting, and attaching files. These designs were created to be scalable in nature, and the next step is figuring out how the future features of the Assignment viewer will inform the next iteration of design.
