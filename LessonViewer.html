            Realize is a learning management system. It is the platform that contains all of Pearson’s digital products. Teachers can assign work to students, grade their assignments, host discussions and access their lesson plans in Realize. Subsequently, students go to realize to complete, and submit their assigned work for the teacher to grade. Previously only 6% of users starting homework sessions were able to complete and submit all parts of the assignment. The new designs increased the turn in rate to over 60%. <br><br> <b> Jump to a section </b>

            Starting research
          </div>
            Based on Quantitative Research from Google Analytics, <b>only 6% of our Students turn in their assignments</b>. Additionally, we lost out on a large adoption sale because <b>realize was “not a robust process for the student.”</b> The current problem is that the student turn-in workflow in realize is very complicated. Students often miss parts of their assignment, students can easily submit an incomplete assignment, and submitting an assignment can often be hidden so students miss submission entirely. <br><br> <b>Students need an easy way to work through, and turn in their assignments on Realize. </b>
            <br><br> From this backround research, the team decided on 3 success measurements:

            The current workflow has the student going to each part of the assignment on a new page. Below is an outline of the general user workflow for completing and turning in an assignment, as well as wires to what the UI used to look like.  <br><br>
            There are a few key problems with this current workflow. <b>The constant back and forth</b> between the actual part of the assignment, and the “November 3rd Assignment Page” meant that Alex would often lose track of his progress. Also, <b>the turn in button, being at the top of the page is inconsistent with the user workflow,</b> where the user would finish all parts, and then have to return to the top of the screen. Finally, having to click into an assignment that has a page to a link that has the reading selection is adding unnecessary clicks.

            In the proposed workflow, I reduced the number of times you have to jump back and forth between the assignment details page (Nov 3rd Assignment Page) and the actual parts of the assignment. Alex no longer has to click on a link to open up a reading selection, and Alex and turn in his assignment when he is done with it, without having to leave the screen.

            Competitive analysis
          </div>
            One of the goals is to have an advantage over our competitors. We looked at what our competitors were doing and how we could improve upon them. Mainly, our competitors do not have a feature to allow students to traverse multiple parts of the assignment. <br><br>McGraw Hill (our #1 competitor) has multiple parts to the assignment, but they are not customizable. Each part of the assignment has a forced structure. In other words, the content has stricter limitations. Our solution needs to be more scalable. We liked the simplicty of their text and icons<br><br>HMH (#2 competitor) does not have a robust assignment viewer. Students must enter and exit the assignment, and the teacher can only assign 1 content item per assignment. Their approach is similar to what Pearson has currently. <br><br>We also looked at Google material design for Tab UI patterns. We liked the simplicity and the easy of use. We also noted that many of our target users use Google Classroom and other google products, so they may be familiar with this pattern already. However, Google’s design does not account for long titles like ours.

            Wireframes and usability testing
          </div>
            To validate that our designs, we wanted to test the solution. I created wireframes for usability and AB testing. While the metric used to indicate the problem was quantitative, we were limited in timeframe and budget. Ideally, I would have liked to use quantitative data in addition to qualitative to get a more accurate comparison. I created 2 different prototypes. One solution has a long vertical scroll, the other solution has tabs. Both solutions are more robust than the current designs. To test this, we used a task based A/B usability test on (5) Teachers and (6) Students in the Hoboken Area switching off the first prototype we showed to account for bias. We asked them the following tasks:

            Key insights
          </div>
            The original designs of the lesson viewer had a fixed navigation bar. We needed to support varying types of content, so the lesson viewer may have alot of scrolling. To test this, we asked the team to provide samples of different assignments. The most common device that this is used on is a chromebook, so we wanted to design for 1024 by 768. With 768 height, around 20 out of 56 samples required scrolling in the assignment viewer. The problem with the fixed header is that it covers a lot of the content. We came up with 3 different solutions to deal with this: (1) Design a fixed header and make the content shorter; (2) Design an inline header, so that the user can focus on the content; (3) Design a header that is inline, but appears when the user is done with that part of the assignment or on scroll up.

            Constraints & visual exploration
          </div>
            We then wanted to explore different visual treatments of this “tab” design. Below are some of the different ways we looked at exploring tabs. We looked at Material Design, flat design, and some more traditional approaches.<br><br> Based off of a combination of stakeholder feedback, and design heuristics, we decided to go with the white tabs on blue background (left design). Additionally, the tab approach allowed for better readability with color contrast, and allowed us to use colors in a more meaningful way. In a future update, we will use color as a way of allowing the user to know the status of the assignment (blue means the assignment is in progress and green means the assignment is complete).

The overwhelming majority of our users access Realize using a laptop. This means that while the designs are not mobile first, we still need to consider this use case. The mobile designs are more simple, and have more information that users might not care about hidden in a menu, such as due-date and other parts of the assignment. We want to make sure that Alex can complete his assignment at any time. </div></div>

            The final product consisted of many different states. Shown below are only a few of these states, but the Assignment viewer is live in Realize today. Currently, Google analytics shows that the turn in rate has dramatically increased (higher than 60%), which is far better than the previous designs. The next step is to validate even further to see how well we solved the problem. Also, there are going to be more features released in relation to the lesson viewer, including Rubrics functionality, teacher-student commenting, and attaching files. These designs were created to be scalable in nature, and the next step is figuring out how the future features of the Assignment viewer will inform the next iteration of design.
