            Cloud machine is a puzzle game created for students in grades 3-8. Students play the game by moving liquid across a sequence of gates. They split liquid (divide fractions) mix colors (add fractions) and measure the liquid (identify fractions) in various ways.

          The first (of many) brainstorms came in the form of a general open game-jam. To facilitate, we broke into small groups of 3 people each. Each team had 20 minutes to generate as many ideas as possible, with 20 additional minutes to select the best ideas and present them back to the team. We brainstormed around the following statement:
          <b>How might we create a fractions math game?</b>

            After presenting all the ideas, a smaller team (design, product and SME) meet to discuss the next steps. After looking at all the ideas, there was one common theme that kept being discussed. Liquid is a great and flexible visualization tool to help understand fractions. With that in mind, we conducted another group brainstorm around the following statement:
            <b>How might we use liquid to visualize fractions in a game?</b><br> <br>The team came up with 5 ideas to prototype: 
            <ul>
              <li>Ghost lines - Students measure the amount of liquid through fractions by dragging their mouse and creating lines.</li>
              <li>Paint smear - Students combine paint by dragging their finger across the screen and splitting the liquid into fractions.</li>
              <li>Water gate - Students move liquid by opening gates and create fractional amounts by splitting liquid and adding it back up.</li>
              <li>Iterator - Students make their own fractions by splitting containers (denominator) and adding water to them (numerator).
              </li>
              <li>Shape Clippers - Students break shapes into different sizes by cutting them and drawing lines.</li>

                The team was able to build these prototypes within 2 days, with the understanding that it was throw away code. There were many objectives, but here are some of the main ones:<br><br>
                <ol>
                  <li>How will students react to these prototypes? What do students like and dislike about each?</li>
                  <li>How feasible is it to create this game in a limited time frame?</li>
                  <li>What other opportunities will the game open up in terms of fractions and liquid? </li>
                </ol>
      
                We decided to test 3 of the 5 prototypes. <br><br>
                We dropped the Shape Clippers game because it was technically unfeasible with the given time frame. We also dropped the game called Paint smear, since it ended up being too limited in gameplay and would not be scalable for our needs later on. However, paint smear ended up being a critical component later on in the process, as it inspired how the game works for color mixing.

      We wanted to show the game to our users and see their initial reaction. While the games have very poor ux and design at this stage, we wanted to make sure students were able to make the connection between the game and the math. The lack of UI and UX did cause issues with user testing, especially since students were more biased towards interfaces that were easier for them to understand, but the tradeoff is that we can learn very VERY early about what ideas will work and what ideas will not.

        <b>Methodology: </b>
        Students were asked to play 1 of the 3 prototypes in a randomized order. Moderators went around the room to observe students playing in their classroom as an activity assigned by the teacher, then asked follow up questions to check comprehension and engagement.<br><br>
        <b>Participants: </b>
        Tested with 39 students. 22 3rd graders and 17 4th graders. 4 teammates were present as moderators and observers. 1 teacher interview was conducted based off of the findings of the study. <br><br>
        <b>Student preference</b>
        Most students preferred the Watergate (25), some preferred the iterator (8) and few preferred the ghost lines (6).

      <ul>
        <li>The visualization of the iterator was confusing, and only students with a very high knowledge of fractions were able to conceptually understand what was happening. </li>
        <li>The watergate prototype was by far the most fun for most students. They also found it the most intuitive with little to no instruction. However, this prototype had the least conceptual understanding of fractions.</li>
        <li>The ghostlines prototype was very difficult to use, so many students did not enjoy it. Students often used trackpads, and the interaction is dragging, which can be very difficult for computers with poor sensitivity. Once the student understood the game, they found it too easy, as you are basically just lining up the bottom and top visuals. </li>
        <li> How might we incorperate the main mechanics and interaction of the Watergate prototype with the visulization of the iterator and the precision and measurement of the ghostlines without causing a difficulty spike?</li>

        After getting feedback from our users, the next few steps were clear. We wanted to use watergate as basis for the main game; however, there were some powerful elements from other ideas that we wanted to incorporate.

          The next (and longest step) is putting all of the user and stakeholder feedback into visuals and specifications. To do this, we used Adobe XD for interactions, and Illustrator for artstyles. We also used confluence to create a holistic design specification, and separated dev tasks using JIRA.

          After the MVP was created, we did another round of user testing. This time, it was much more focused on specific qualitative performance indicators and research questions. We wanted to know:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>How fun is Cloud Machine?</li>
            <li>How Usable is Cloud Machine?</li>
            <li>Is Cloud Machine successful at its learning objectives related to fractions?</li>
            <li>What authorable content can be changed before release?</li>

          <b>Key Findings</b><br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Overall, results were mostly positive, students rated the game an average of 8 on a scale of 1-10</li>
            <li>Students disliked the overal difficulty of the game and wished it was easier.</li>
            <li>There were many issues with the discoverability of the what gates were clickable and what gates were not. </li>
            <li>“Conceptual blocks” where students reached content above grade level were frustrating</li>
            <li>Most interactions were not a problem for students, and if it was a problem, they generally relied on the teacher or other classmates around them to solve some issues. </li>

                Students were asked to play Cloud Machine for 20 minutes and observe gameplay. They were then asked questions about their experience, based off of their interactions. Pain Points were recorded and empathy maps were filled out by the researcher (me and my colleague).<br><br>
                <b>Participants: </b>

                <b>Average enjoyment rating:</b> 8/10. Considering 0 is a boring lesson and 10 is a very fun game, such as Fortnite.<br><br>
                5 out of 6 students would want to play again in their classroom. <br>

            Since the last round of user tests was focused on specific changes that were realistic to make before the release, another round of user tests were conducted to better evaluate potential features to increase engagement.<br><br>
            Additionally, we now had quantitative data for us to sort through. The next step is to use the quantitative data to determine next steps. Particularly, many students fail levels frequently, which is an indicator of guess and check behavior. The next user test may investigate why this is happening. <br><br>
