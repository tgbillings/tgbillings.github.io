            It is estimated that about 15.1 million adults have Alcohol use disorder (AUD), but only 1.3 million adults get treatment for AUD. In my HCI studio class, we decided to develop some solutions that are feasible for most people, and allow people to track their sobriety at any time, and any place. In order to better track their sobriety status, we created a wrist-brand to record their sobriety level as well as an app to keep track of their progress. Additionally, the most important feature of the app helped create an AUD community that has a similar format to Alcoholics Anonymous.

            Competitve Analysis
          </div>
            In our research, we found many cutting-edge solutions, such as persuasive technologies, cognitive behavior therapy, online social networking, and AA meetings. But lots of them are either expensive, time assuming or inaccessible to users. We found that internal punishment is one of the most effective ways to change behaviors. Additionally, we discovered positive reinforcement works better than negative reinforcement, but people do need negative reinforcement at some points.

            User Interviews and Research
          </div>
            We started to conduct user interviews to get a better scope of the problem. These interviews were largely unstructured. We asked about the problems people face, the different solutions they have tried, and what worked for them. We also presented different artifacts we found from the competitive analysis, and asked what they thought. Our interview pool consisted of a Cornell Counselor who specializes in Alcohol use, people who have AUD who are currently recovering, people who have fully recovered from AUD, and friends and families of AUD people. <br><br> We also looked at online Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and observed online resources such as interviews and recovery studies. We used all of this information to create our Persona Mark, and to define his goals.

            Sponsors are one of the most helpful ways to stay sober so we want <b>to allow users to find a compatible sponsor.</b><br><br>It is important to have close relationships with your sponsor so we want to <b>contact the sponsor at moments where the user is vulnerable.</b><br><br>There is no one specific cause for drinking (AA online meetings) which means we have to make sure the sponsor is able to <b>code the solution</b> since there is no general solution.<br><br>Connections with other recovering alcoholics can be inconvenient in person, but ultimately people find them invaluable. This means we want to include a way to <b>talk with other AUDs online.</b>
        </div>
          <br><br> We then created a storyboard to help visualize these 4 key solutions we wanted in our product.

            More User Feedback
          </div>
            After creating our storyboard, we decided to visualize our final idea using a paper prototype. With this paper prototype, we conducted three user testings and got tvaluable feedbacks from those AUD people and professionals. We then created mid-fidelity prototype using Balsamiq. After another round of user testing and evaluation, we made a high-fidelity prototype using Sketch, inVision.

            From this user testing, we made many different changes. Two of the biggest ones were getting rid of the ability to find another sponsor, and adding better tracking capabilities, as well as the ability to share this data. You can send it to your sponsor or other people who you chat with to get encouragement on your goals. Below are some quotes from the user interviews that helped us make this decision.

            <b>Why we took out the Sponsor Connection Feature:</b><br><br>
            “I don’t trust an app to find a good sponsor”<br>
            “I don’t think the iphone would help people. The AA community does a great job of this already”<br>
            “It’s hard to judge someone based off of the text description. Also, I really think no one’s gunna put their pic up on a site publicly like that”<br>

            “The calendar is a good idea, i love how I can see my progress.”<br>
            “There is a sense of accomplishment when my sponsees show me their journal.”<br>
