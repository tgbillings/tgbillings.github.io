            Downstream is an action mini-game which has strong timing and precision components but also a fun level-based story progression. As a <b>minimalist 2 button experience,</b> the game should be attractive to casual gamers while also enticing some more serious gamers with its high-level timing challenges. Beautifully drawn and transitioning artwork will provide players a sense of immersion. <b>The fast paced gameplay</b> means the player is constantly moving and reacting to new challenges. Timed mechanics keeps players on their toes. In order to make player choice meaningful, we provide <b>multiple paths to victory</b>. Rather than a linear map for each level, level compel the player to explore and move in different directions. Some paths will be easier or quicker than others, but there are different strategies for approaching challenges as they arise.

Latch, which allows a player to attach themselves to a lily pad and start swimming in a circle around it Burst, which increases the fishes speed to 3 times the current speed, but is limited by the burst gauge.

            Koi uses tethers to get around a level. These can be lily pads or lotus flowers. To move about, Koi catches a tether to start circling it and releases to launch tangentially off of it. Players have to predict the tangent that they will take to successfully move through the level.

            Koi has to light lotus flowers before passing through the end gate. She does this by circling them to help them bloom and expose the fire they contain. The player will have to be quick when encountering these more volatile lotuses. Circling a lotus for too long can be dangerous due to obstacles, so Koi will have to leave and return to reignite it. Lotus flowers are essential to the progression of the game, providing its destination-based story a puzzle-based gameplay mechanic as the player progresses.

          There are 3 main types of patterns that the players must overcome. In early levels, the player learns the mechanics and faces some of these patterns independently. In later levels, we use composite patterns and combine multiple types of challenges into one.<br><br>
            <b>Threading the Needle</b><br><br>
            Threading the Needle is getting through a tight space. Players can take as much time as they want but must be precise in their aiming. This takes precision and prediction skills. You must be able to predict where Koi will go, and aim precisely.

            <b>Sketch testing</b><br><br>
            At first, there were two different concepts we wanted to explore. The first was a Space concept, where players would control a spaceship and abduct cows by orbiting the planet, and the second was a Koi fish concept where the player swims in a pond and lights up lily pads by swimming around them. We tested both concepts, through simple comparison. We asked the players which they preferred. 12 of the 32 players preferred the river concept, and 20 preferred the cow space concept. Even though the cow space concept had a higher quantity, the artists decided the river concept was more fun, and provided greater creative flexibility.

            We first tested a non-digital version of the designs to see if they were valid or not. We created a cardboard prototype to test with around 30 players. The paper prototype was used to capture different game elements to test at a low cost. We found that players enjoyed the prediction aspect of the game, where users are trying to predict the outcome before they move spaces forward. Players did not like the slow pace of the paper prototype.
