            Project Imagine is a Product for High School Social Studies Teachers and Students. There are 6 different templates we created for Project Imagine, which use primary sources (first person accounts of history) and learning activities to engage in with the primary source. Teachers can assign Project Imagine parts to students and assess their answers. All of these templates are authorable, meaning that (Pearson) editors can put in different content to fit content. This is a high level overview of the entire project, and does not include many specific design details because of NDA's.

            A challenge Social Studies Teachers are facing is re-developing their course structure to fit changes in state curriculum. There is a new standard called the C3 Framework that many school districts have switched to. We need to make sure our new product’s learning objectives will fit the curriculum in addition to consider was how this product will help teachers transition from their former curriculum to their newer curriculum.
            <br><br> Additionally, the research team was able to provide some key insight:

            From the user journey, we defined some of the Product requirements. This product allows students to analyze primary sources and connect them to their own experiences. We want empathy to encourage critical thinking for the students, and to engage them by trying to apply the primary source to something relatable. Empathy is one of the keys in fitting in with the learning objective while still allowing students to be excited about the content. We also needed to make sure that this product was adaptable to the lesson plan of the teachers.

            There are a ton of products that are similar in nature to what we want to do, but none that are solving the same problem. While looking at competitors products, the two things we were looking for were immersiveness and analysis. While not all of the products we looked at had learning objectives, what we really wanted to incorporate was immersiveness for students to be engaged and thus remember the primary sources.

            To map out the flow from start to end, we created a general site map. We discovered the capabilities and limitations of our platform (Realize), which both limits and expands the scope of our project. We also had to work in parallel with the editors, so mapping out a general guideline and IA helped us work in unison without having to waterfall. Finally, this step is important in helping estimation for the scope of the project.

            The team and I created a few sketches of how we thought the designs might work. These paper prototypes allowed us to get a high level overview of how the designs would fit together, and make sure our learning objectives were fulfilled on a high level. <br><br> In the paper prototype, we created 6 different templates as to how these “immersives” would work. The 7 designs are as follows: 2d Roleplay, Parallax Roleplay, Opinion Polling, 360 Tour, Decision Tree, and Map & Timeline

            The Roleplay template has the student playing a “character” in which they can move from room to room, and explore all of the different primary sources and complete a short analysis of the primary source in that area. Below is a mid-fidelity mock up of this particular immersive. The student selects the character they want to play as (the white woman), then can explore different objects (Primary Sources) in the room, such as the newspaper or the radio. These artifacts are then paired with an activity for the student to complete.

            Validation
          </div>
            To validate our designs and ideas, we conducted user interviews with 5 Social Studies teachers and 7 high school students to get their feedback. The interview was structured around the following research questions: <br><br>

            “Are the learning Objectives of Project Imagine clearly matched by the C3 Framework?”,<br>
            “Does Project Imagine engage students through empathy?”, <br>
            “Is Project Imagine flexible enough for a US History teacher to use in her Classroom”,<br>
            “Are students engaging with Primary sources in a meaningful way?”<br><br>

             We also asked the System Usability Score, the Net Promoter Score to get a rating of the general business idea, and the Technology Acceptance Model to understand the usefulness and practicality of the design. We also asked the user to perform some light usability tasks so that we could get at some navigation issues with our pre-existing platform.

          </div><b>Perspective shift</b><br><br>
            One feedback from stakeholders is that we want to make sure this product is truly immersive. The key learning objective is teaching students about world war II through empathy. To let them experience this for themselves, we switched the perspectives form how students are interacting with primary sources. Rather than showing them in 3rd person, we switched to first person. <br><br>

            Another way to ramp up the immersion is to add gamification elements. This was particularly useful in the decision tree. We wanted to add a meaningful choice for the students. The current implementation meant that there were no wrong answers for students. In the test, we found that students often were quick to realize this, and started to just click without paying attention to the content. A guided exploration approach means that we push them towards the correct answers, but allow them to fail and learn from their mistakes. To make the mistakes punishing (but not too punishing) we made the user hit a wall and read a passage when they pick a clearly incorrect choice. Finally, I needed to give students a way to know how far along they were in the decision tree, so I added a progress indicator.

            Due to the feedback from teachers and students, we needed to provide a wider breadth of activities for students to complete after finishing their primary source. To do this, we ideated and came up with a few different solutions, based on different types of content that Pearson has previous used that were successful.

            Finally, our users were complaining about the lack of sophistication in the illustrations and images. Using photography allowed for more sophistication, but it also meant that we were always immersing students in real events and primary sources. This meant that having real images truly made the experience close to what these people during world war II would have actually seen. The limitation is that we cannot animate photographs, and there are also heavy copyright issues around editing for these photographs.

            The question at this stage was: How will this product perform in the real world. Do social studies students and teachers use Project Imagine in a way that meets their needs? We conducted a field and daily journal study to see how users would use this product in the classroom. We had 3 participating classroom use Project Imagine in their lesson plan. I did not participate in the field observation, but was briefed on the outcome by the research team, and participated in the creation of the survey. We asked questions such as: “What did you like most about this program?”, “Please describe your overall impression” and “Do you feel that students actively made connections between the primary source and the associated activity?” for teachers. Both teachers and students filled out an exit survey.

            Many of the problems stemmed from content being too long, or taking too long to complete. Our next challenge was to try to shorten the length of time students were spending on the product. Our goal was to try to hit around 20 minutes per template. This greatly influenced how we wanted to show the Primary sources, making them shorter, but still focused and meeting the learning objectives. We also solved for many usability issues, including navigation between different characters, and meeting WCAG 2.0 standards.

            Iterative product cycles rarely ever end. Post release of the product, we will capture quantitative analysis. Most of the preliminary research was qualitative in nature, and while it answers the “why” factor, it does not answer the “how.” <br><br> The product process could have been improved in a few ways. We jumped right into designing all 6 different templates for project imagine. Some of the issues from one template were projected onto all of the templates, but they went undiscovered until testing. It is important to find large scale issues in small components quickly so that we don’t have to go back to change all of them. <br><br> Additionally, there were many limitations of the platform that are currently being updated to better support different products. Since the teams work in parallel, we needed to release the product before some platform features could support what we needed. In future iterations we would like to take advantage of these updates to the platform to better fit our needs.
