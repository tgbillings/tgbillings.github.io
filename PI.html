            Project Overview
          </div>
            Project Imagine is a Product for High School Social Studies Teachers and Students. There are 6 different templates we created for Project Imagine, which use primary sources (first person accounts of history) and learning activities to engage in with the primary source. Teachers can assign Project Imagine parts to students and assess their answers. All of these templates are authorable, meaning that (Pearson) editors can put in different content to fit content.

            Background Research
          </div>
            A challenge Social Studies Teachers are facing is re-developing their course structure to fit changes in state curriculum. There is a new standard called the C3 Framework that many school districts have switched to. We need to make sure our new product’s learning objectives will fit the curriculum in addition to consider was how this product will help teachers transition from their former curriculum to their newer curriculum.
                        <br><br> Additionally, the research team was able to provide some key insight:

            Product Goals and Learning Objectives
          </div>
            Based off of the new C3 Framework, we (Insturctional Designer, Editor and I) came up with a “Learning Journey” for the student (Persona Adam) that who would could meet the learning objectives.

            From the user journey, we defined some of the Product requirements. This product allows students to analyze primary sources and connect them to their own experiences. We want empathy to encourage critical thinking for the students, and to engage them by trying to apply the primary source to something relatable. Empathy is one of the keys in fitting in with the learning objective while still allowing students to be excited about the content. We also needed to make sure that this product was adaptable to the lesson plan of the teachers.

            Competitive Insights
          </div>
            There are a ton of products that are similar in nature to what we want to do, but none that are solving the same problem. While looking at competitors products, the two things we were looking for were imersiveness and analysis. While not all of the products we looked at had learning objectives, what we really wanted to incorporate was immersiveness for students to be engaged and thus remember the primary sources.
