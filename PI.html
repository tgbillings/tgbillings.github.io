            Social Studies Teachers need a Product that fits the C3 Framework. How do we engage students with 1st person sources of history while fitting the new state framework? As a UX designer, I researched and discovered 6 different digital templates for high school history teachers to engage students through perspective and empathy.<br><br>

             There are a ton of products that inspired us. To get a better idea of our scope, we looked at the learning potential and engagement factor of other products.

            Iterative product cycles rarely ever end. Post release of the product, we will capture quantitative analysis. Most of the preliminary research was qualitative in nature, and while it answers the “why” factor, it does not answer the “how.” <br><br> The product process could have been improved in a few ways. We jumped right into designing all 6 different templates for project imagine. Some of the issues from one template were projected onto all of the templates, but they went undiscovered until testing. It is important to find large scale issues in small components quickly so that we don’t have to go back to change all of them. <br><br> Additionally, there were many limitations of the platform that are currently being updated to better support different products. Since the teams work in parallel, we needed to release the product before some platform features could support what we needed. In future iterations we would like to take advantage of these updates to the platform to better fit our needs.
