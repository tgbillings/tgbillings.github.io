              <li>Many students use a track-pad and were unable to drag over areas, or would accidentally double click.</li>
              <li>Some students were initially unmotivated to build their own puzzle, but became motivated once they learned that they could share the puzzle with their classmates.</li>

              <li>All users gave a positive “fun” rating, where 1 is an assignment and 10 is fortnight. The average was 8.</li>

            <b> Story telling & reward sequence </b>
            <p id = "GA">Students were confused on why they were creating puzzles, so we wanted to provide more story. In other levels, you play the game to make rain, which will feed/animate plants and animals. The problem with having normal rewards in the puzzle creator is that we cannot account for how many puzzles the students will make. In theory, the students could make 1000s of puzzles. We needed a way for the rewards to be scalable, so we made rewards temporary for these levels.

            <b> Brush interaction </b>
            <p id = "GA">Students have difficulty dragging with a trackpad (on top of being non WCAG compliant). Many students were also frustrated that the double-click would delete a previously created container. To account for this, we changed the way that you create puzzle components on the screen. Rather than dragging across a grid, you select a tool and then click on the grid with the tool selected. This acts as a brush, and “paints” the selected component onto the grid.

              We also dramatically changed the look and feel of the UI, so we wanted to validate all of our changes since the last user test.

            <b>Tutorials</b>
            <p id = "GA">Many students did not have the vocabulary or knowledge of fractions to play this game effectively. We created a short tutorial to help the student understand the basics fractions, and to better get at the some more complicated terms, such as Numerator and Denominator.

Students will only unlock the puzzle creator after they have completed this requirement.

        <p id = "GA">
          After the full release of the puzzle creator, we observed that <b>active student playtime for middle grades increased by 12%</b>. This means we were successful in our goal of increasing student play time for middle grade students. </p>
          <p>One part of the project that did not go smoothly is the user recruitment during the pandemic. Because of this, we were unable to visit schools, which often paints a different picture. This may affect how students performed in the usability tests, and also may have an impact on the quantitative data. Additionally, we used “Friends and family” testing, which means that we tested with the students of internal colleagues. I suspect that students of parents who work for an educational company may behave differently than students whose parents do not. </p>
